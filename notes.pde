// need to get rid of corner error, or possibly keep it because it makes the game more fun.
    // maybe make it a powerup to be able to glitch into walls.

// need to make multiple enemies that semi-randomly searches for you while running away from boundaries.
   // if you get in the enemys ray-cast it will immediatly set its desired velocity to your direction.
   // Could either create another ray-cast algorithm to detect intersections between circles OR
      // Could treat the Cirlce as a boundary. (the boundary would encapsulate the circle).

// if you get to the goal spot (green square on screen) ;
   // another searcher will spawn and you will be randomly placed back on the screen.
   
// optimise the "edgesOfRayPos" algorithm 
   // only check boundaries that are within an arbitrary checking radius
   
// Be able to kill enemies if you "Shoot them" 
   // if you are in a certain radius then you can click and it auto kills them 
       // big thick red line from you to the enemy
       
// make it all look good
